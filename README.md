# Leap_Year_Checker
Code to check which years in the Gregorian Calendar are Leap Years

The main program 'LeapYearChecker' looks to count all possible leap years within a given year range and output that total count to a console.
The output of the console is also recorded as a .txt file

The 'LeapYearChecker' code also uses the information collated to create a CSV file with a 'Year' column and a 'LeapYear' column, each row in the file containing the data retrieved by the 'LeapYearChecker' functionality.
In the same way the script creates a JSON file holding the same information.

The UnitTesting file has been created to preliminarily test the developed functionality during development. The Unit Testing acted as a guide to ensure development was working as expected before any type of commit to GitHub.
